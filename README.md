This is a repo of all the projects I completed on the [Frontend-Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website.
Each branch of this repository will contain a particular project. The approach was the best I could find for the problem of trying to host multiple websites with each one having a independent folder in one big github repo using github pages.
