## My process
I started with a quick analysis to the mobile design to determine how the HTMl structure will be and which CSS tools I am going to use to achieve the desired layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how CSS grid is perhaps the perfect solution for layouts that have elements with identical structure and using the gap property to separate the multiple elements is ideal if the distance between them is consistent.
